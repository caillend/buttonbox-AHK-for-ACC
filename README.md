# buttonbox-AHK-for-ACC
A simple script to rebind most of the numblock to keybinds when ACC is the active window.

Download the AHK if you want to review the file and then compile it yourself.

It requires AutoHotkey to be installed on your system.

It also has to be run as administrator, otherwise it won't work.
